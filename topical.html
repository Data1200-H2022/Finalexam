    THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN SOCIETY AND TECHNOLOGY 
    
    1.  The Internet has grown into a ubiquitous infrastructure that societies all over the world are increasingly reliant on. To which extent and how does the internet have political consequences? Note down some examples and discuss with your colleagues. (From module 1.3)
The internet is widely considered a global tool for societal change, especially regarding smaller countries. Not only for change, but also for awareness of happenings around the world – this pushes an issue forward and encourages financial support from third parties during for example natural disasters and makes it harder for happenings in the world to be swept under the rug. An active example would be the Black Lives Matter movement that was rocketed by internet protests leading into physical protests against police brutality after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. In 2021 when a Texas bill was pushed forward to redefine the child abuse laws to include providing children with medicine to transition, such as hormone blockers, the public outrage globally (pushed by internet activists) caused the White House to publicly condemn it (Alfonseca, 2022).
There is no such thing as a flawless system, and that applies just as well to the internet as a political tool. The internet gives anyone the ability to say anything for an audience who is willing to listen, even anonymously. This has often been abused to spread misinformation or form a following to conspiracy theories. For example, people who bear potentially harmful ideologies can find support in smaller groups over the internet that they might not have found in their local political groups. This leads to a rise of ideologies that otherwise could not impact society as a whole. 

2. Consider the statement "The person who invented the train invented the train crash." What are your thoughts about the societal responsibility of innovators? (From module 1.4)
The thought that the person who invented x is responsible for any negatives considering x invention is a Kantian value that generally applies to wider fields in our society; the person who invented the bomb is responsible for bombing cities. That value drives people to maximise safety of a product before releasing it to the use of general public, and the threat of misuse is actively prevented in development.
Development of society is always needed, for solving the problems we are facing. Solutions have absolutely some advantages and disadvantages. If the disadvantages are widely outweighed by the advantages, we cannot discard a good solution for the improbable risk of damage. If we specifically use the train as an example, the development of trains has far more advantages than they have risk of safety. Accord to SSB, in the year 2021 there was as 41 million train trips in the country (Statistisk Sentralbyrå, n.d.). If we compare that to the last time there was any dangerous accidents, 2010, we see that the use of trains far outweighs the likelihood of something dangerous happening (Wikipedia, 2022).
