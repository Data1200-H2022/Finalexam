                <h2>Internet as a tool</h2>
                <p>The internet is widely considered a global tool for societal change, especially regarding smaller countries. Not only for change, but also for awareness of happenings around the world – this pushes an issue forward and encourages financial support from third parties during for example natural disasters, and makes it harder for happenings in the world to be swept under the rug. An active example would be the <abbr title="Black Lives Matter">BLM</abbr> movement that was rocketed by internet protests leading into physical protests against police brutality after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd">the murder of George Floyd</a> in 2020. In 2021 when a Texas bill was pushed forward to redefine the child abuse laws to include providing children with medicine to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition">transition</a>, such as hormone blockers, the public outrage globally (pushed by internet activists) caused the White House to publicly condemn it, as reported on by the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/white-house-condemns-texas-anti-trans-directive-calls/story?id=83070044">ABC news</a> in 2022.</p>
                <p>There is no such thing as a flawless system, and that applies especially well to the internet as a political tool. The internet gives <em>anyone</em> the ability to say anything for an audience who is willing to listen, even anonymously. This has often been abused to spread misinformation or form a following to conspiracy theories. For example, people who bear potentially harmful ideologies can find support in smaller groups over the internet that they might not have found in their local political groups. This leads to a rise of ideologies that otherwise could not impact society as a whole. It has also been used to gather large amounts of people to support harmful causes, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">the January 6th attack on Capitol hill</a>, USA. </p>
        
            
            <p>Consider the statement "The person who invented the train invented the train crash." Do inventors really hold the societal responsiblity of consequence?</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="child r">
                <h2>The conflict of consequence</h2>
                <p>The thought that the person who invented x is responsible for any negatives considering x invention is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kantian</a> value that generally applies to wider fields in our society; the person who invented the bomb is responsible for bombing cities. That value drives people to maximise safety of a product before releasing it to the use of general public, and the threat of misuse is actively prevented in development.
                Development of society is always needed, for solving the problems we are facing. Solutions have absolutely some advantages <b>and</b> disadvantages. If the disadvantages are widely outweighed by the advantages, we <i>cannot</i> discard a good solution for the improbable risk of damage. If we specifically use the train as an example, the development of trains has far more advantages than they have risk of safety. According to SSB, <q>in the year 2021 there was as 41 million train trips in the country</q>. If we compare that to the last time there was any dangerous <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jernbaneulykker_i_Norge">accidents</a>, 2010, we see that the use of trains far outweighs the likelihood of something dangerous happening. </p>
